# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that helps
with single-package repos and multi-package repos to version and publish your code.

See the full documentation for it in the [Changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

We use Changesets to create release PRs and publish to npm from merged commits that include
`*.md` files in this folder.

Common questions are answered in the
[Changesets docs](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md).
