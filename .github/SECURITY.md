# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please use GitHub's built-in private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/farce1/handover/security/advisories) page
2. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
3. Fill in the details of the vulnerability

We will review your report and respond on a best-effort basis. There is no formal SLA, but we take security seriously and will prioritize confirmed vulnerabilities.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest published version only.

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| Latest  | Yes       |
| Older   | No        |

## Disclosure Policy

We follow coordinated disclosure. If you report a vulnerability, we ask that you:

- Give us reasonable time to investigate and address the issue before any public disclosure
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it
