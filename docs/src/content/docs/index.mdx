## Start quickly

1. Install the package and initialize your project.
2. Configure provider keys and defaults.
3. Generate documentation with a single command.

## Explore by outcome

- **I am onboarding a new repo**: [Getting started](/handover/user/getting-started/)
- **I need CLI flags and environment details**: [Command reference](/handover/reference/commands/)
- **I need release history**: [Changelog](/handover/reference/changelog/)
- **I want to contribute to the project**: [Contributor development guide](/handover/contributor/development/)

## Install

```bash title="Install package"
npm install --save-dev handover-cli
```

## First command

```bash title="Generate docs"
npx handover-cli generate
```

After setup, edit `.handover.yml` and rerun the generator. You can also run `--static-only` to build starter docs without any LLM calls.
