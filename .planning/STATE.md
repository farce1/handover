# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-16)

**Core value:** A single `handover generate` command produces a complete, cross-referenced knowledge base that eliminates the 2-4 week onboarding gap when codebases change hands.
**Current focus:** Phase 3: Static Analysis Pipeline

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 9 (Static Analysis Pipeline)
Plan: 1 of 4 in current phase (03-01 complete)
Status: Analyzer foundation built -- types, file discovery, cache, context
Last activity: 2026-02-16 -- Completed 03-01-PLAN.md (analyzer foundation)

Progress: [█████████░] 70%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 7
- Average duration: 6min
- Total execution time: 43min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-01 | 3 tasks | 3min | 3min |
| 01-02 | 2 tasks | 3min | 3min |
| 01-03 | 3 tasks | 4min | 4min |
| 02-01 | 3 tasks | 5min | 5min |
| 02-02 | 2 tasks | 15min | 15min |
| 02-03 | 3 tasks | 9min | 9min |
| 03-01 | 3 tasks | 4min | 4min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 4min, 5min, 15min, 9min, 4min
- Trend: stabilizing, foundation plans remain fast

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 9-phase comprehensive roadmap derived from 91 requirements following data-flow dependency order
- [Roadmap]: Phase 8 (Providers/Reliability) depends on Phase 5 not Phase 7, enabling parallel work with Terminal UX
- [Phase 01]: Schema-first: Zod schemas are single source of truth, types derived via z.infer
- [Phase 02]: tree-sitter-wasms prebuilt WASM grammars over self-building (avoids Docker requirement)
- [Phase 02]: New ParsedFileSchema in src/parsing/types.ts, existing SourceFileSchema kept for backward compatibility
- [Phase 02]: createRequire for WASM path resolution in ESM context
- [Phase 02]: Per-language RegexFallbackExtractor instances (langId pre-configured, since extractFromSource has no langId param)
- [Phase 02]: Dynamic import with try-catch for TS/Python extractors in createParserService() (graceful when 02-02 not yet run)
- [Phase 02]: getNamedChildren() null-safe utility for web-tree-sitter namedChildren iteration
- [Phase 02]: Downgraded web-tree-sitter to 0.25.10 for tree-sitter-wasms ABI compatibility (dylink vs dylink.0)
- [Phase 02]: JSX component detection via @component decorator marker on JSX-returning functions
- [Phase 02]: Python visibility by naming convention (__name=private, _name=protected, dunder=public)
- [Phase 03]: AnalysisContext interface in types.ts (avoids circular dep with cache.ts)
- [Phase 03]: AnalyzerResult<T> as both Zod schema factory and TS interface for flexibility
- [Phase 03]: fast-glob ALWAYS_IGNORE for traversal exclusion + ignore for .gitignore post-filter
- [Phase 03]: Object.freeze for immutable shared context (STAT-09 requirement)
