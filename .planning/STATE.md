## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- In-repo markdown over docs site (no VitePress/Docusaurus until user base demands it)
- Distill AGENTS.md + PRD.md into structured docs/ — originals retired after Phase 3
- Keep README structure, additive changes only (links and badges)
- Use release-please (not semantic-release) — PR-based review gate before npm publish

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GitHub Sponsors account status unknown — FUNDING.yml requires Sponsors to be enabled on the account; verify before Phase 1 plan 03 executes, or mark as conditional
- Vitest LCOV coverage config unverified — Phase 2 plan 01 needs @vitest/coverage-v8 with lcov reporter; check vitest.config.ts before building CI workflow
- AGENTS.md and PRD.md distillation scope unknown — read both files at Phase 3 plan start to scope the restructuring effort; PRD.md is ~90KB
