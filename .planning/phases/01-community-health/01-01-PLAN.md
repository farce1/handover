<objective>
Create the three core community health documents (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md) and the GitHub Sponsors configuration (FUNDING.yml).

Purpose: These files signal that the project is credible, welcoming, and has clear governance. GitHub's Community Standards health check relies on detecting these files in `.github/`. FUNDING.yml activates the Sponsors button in the repo header.

Output: Four files in `.github/` — contributor guide, code of conduct, security policy, and funding config.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create CONTRIBUTING.md with full contributor walkthrough</name>
  <files>.github/CONTRIBUTING.md</files>
  <action>
Create `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` with the following sections in order (per locked decisions and research):

1. **Welcome paragraph** — Brief intro: what handover-cli does (generates AI-powered codebase documentation), that contributions are welcome, link to Code of Conduct.

2. **Prerequisites** — Node.js >= 18, git.

3. **Getting Started** — Step-by-step beginner-friendly walkthrough:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/farce1/handover.git
   cd handover
   npm install
   npm run build
   npm test
   ```

4. **Development Commands** — Table or list of all available scripts from package.json:
   - `npm run dev` — Run CLI from source (tsx)
   - `npm run build` — Build with tsup
   - `npm test` — Run tests with vitest
   - `npm run typecheck` — Type-check with tsc

5. **Branch Naming Convention** — Per locked decision: type prefix matching commit types.
   Format: `type/short-description` where type is one of: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`.
   Examples: `feat/add-gemini-provider`, `fix/parser-null-check`, `docs/contributing-guide`.

6. **Commit Message Format** — Per locked decision: Conventional Commits.
   Format: `type(scope): description`
   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`.
   Examples: `feat(providers): add Gemini support`, `fix(parser): handle empty files`.
   Note: aligns with release-please for automated changelog generation.

7. **Opening an Issue** — Point to the issue templates. Note that blank issues are disabled; all issues must use a template (bug report, feature request, or docs improvement).

8. **Submitting a Pull Request** — PR process:
   - Fork the repo and create a branch following the naming convention
   - Make changes, ensuring `npm test` and `npm run typecheck` pass
   - Push your branch and open a PR against `main`
   - Fill out the PR template checklist
   - Community reviewers welcome; maintainer does final merge

9. **Code Review Process** — Per locked decision: contributors encouraged to review each other's PRs. Maintainer gives final approval. Be constructive, focus on the code.

10. **Architecture Overview** — Brief tour of `src/` subdirectories:
    - `src/cli/` — CLI entry point (Commander.js)
    - `src/config/` — Configuration loading and validation
    - `src/domain/` — Zod domain models and types
    - `src/parsing/` — Language parsers (tree-sitter)
    - `src/analyzers/` — Static analysis pipeline (8 analyzers)
    - `src/providers/` — LLM provider adapters (Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.)
    - `src/ai-rounds/` — Multi-round AI analysis orchestration
    - `src/orchestrator/` — DAG-based pipeline orchestrator
    - `src/renderers/` — Document output renderers
    - `src/context/` — Context window management
    - `src/grammars/` — Tree-sitter grammar loading
    - `src/cache/` — Response caching
    - `src/ui/` — Terminal UI components
    - `src/utils/` — Shared utilities

Tone: friendly, direct, beginner-accessible. Use second person ("you"). No corporate jargon.

  <verify>
Verify the file exists and contains key sections:
- `cat .github/CONTRIBUTING.md | head -5` shows the title
- Grep for "Conventional Commits" — must appear
- Grep for "feat/", "fix/", "docs/" — branch naming examples must appear
- Grep for "npm test" and "npm run typecheck" — commands must appear
- Grep for "Architecture" — section must exist
  </verify>
  <done>
CONTRIBUTING.md exists at `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` with all 10 sections: welcome, prerequisites, getting started, dev commands, branch naming, commit format, opening issues, submitting PRs, code review, and architecture overview. All locked decisions (Conventional Commits, branch naming convention, beginner walkthrough, community review policy) are implemented.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, and FUNDING.yml</name>
  <files>.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, .github/SECURITY.md, .github/FUNDING.yml</files>
  <action>
**CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md:**

Create `.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` using the Contributor Covenant v2.1 verbatim text from https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/

Replace the `[INSERT CONTACT METHOD]` placeholder in the Enforcement section with:
```
Please report violations by [opening a private report](https://github.com/farce1/handover/security/advisories/new) or contacting the maintainer through GitHub.
```

This uses the private vulnerability reporting mechanism already established for SECURITY.md, keeping all sensitive communication in one channel. Per Claude's Discretion for contact method details.

**SECURITY.md:**

Create `.github/SECURITY.md` with the following sections (per locked decisions):

1. **Security Policy** — Title heading.

2. **Reporting a Vulnerability** — Clear instruction: "Do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues." Direct users to GitHub's built-in private vulnerability reporting:
   - Link to https://github.com/farce1/handover/security/advisories
   - Step-by-step: go to Security Advisories page, click "Report a vulnerability", fill in details
   - Response timeline: best effort, no specific SLA (per locked decision)

3. **Supported Versions** — Per locked decision: security fixes for latest published version only. Simple table or statement.

4. **Disclosure Policy** — Follow coordinated disclosure: ask reporters to give reasonable time before public disclosure.

**FUNDING.yml:**

Create `.github/FUNDING.yml` with a single line:
```yaml
github: farce1
```

This activates the Sponsors button in the repo header, linking to the `farce1` GitHub Sponsors profile. Note: the button only activates once the Sponsors profile is enrolled (per research pitfall 3 — out of scope for this phase).
  </action>
  <verify>
Verify all three files exist and contain expected content:
- `cat .github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | grep "Contributor Covenant"` — must match
- `cat .github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md | grep "security/advisories/new"` — contact method must be present
- `cat .github/SECURITY.md | grep "Report a vulnerability"` — must match
- `cat .github/SECURITY.md | grep "security/advisories"` — link must be present
- `cat .github/FUNDING.yml` — should output `github: farce1`
  </verify>
  <done>
Three files exist: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Contributor Covenant v2.1 with contact method filled in), SECURITY.md (private vulnerability reporting via GitHub, best-effort response, latest version only), and FUNDING.yml (`github: farce1`). All locked decisions implemented: CC v2.1, no email, best effort, latest version only.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:
1. All four files exist under `.github/`: CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, SECURITY.md, FUNDING.yml
2. CONTRIBUTING.md contains all 10 sections with locked decision content
3. CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md uses Contributor Covenant v2.1 with contact method replaced
4. SECURITY.md points to GitHub private vulnerability reporting, not email
5. FUNDING.yml contains `github: farce1`
6. No files created outside `.github/` directory
