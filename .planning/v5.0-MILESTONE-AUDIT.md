# v5.0 Milestone Audit Report

**Milestone:** v5.0 Remote & Advanced MCP
**Audited:** 2026-02-26
**Status:** tech_debt
**Verdict:** All requirements satisfied by code verification. No critical blockers. Accumulated tech debt from deferred human runtime testing across 4 phases.

**Coverage:** 17/17 requirements satisfied (100%)

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Plans | Verification | Score | Status |
|-------|------|-------|-------------|-------|--------|
| 16 | Streaming QA Session Lifecycle | 2/2 | Yes | 8/8 | human_needed |
| 17 | Local Embedding Provider Routing | 4/4 | Yes | 10/10 | human_needed |
| 18 | Remote Regeneration Job Control | 2/2 | Yes | 6/6 | human_needed |
| 19 | HTTP Transport Parity | 2/2 | **Missing** | N/A | unverified |
| 20 | HTTP Security and Access Controls | 2/2 | Yes | 16/16 | passed |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Integration checker result:** All 18 exports connected, 0 orphaned, 0 missing.

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|-----------|------|-----|--------|
| QA streaming schema → session store → manager → MCP tools | Phase 16 | Phase 16 | Connected |
| QA session manager → registerMcpTools | Phase 16 | Phase 16 | Connected |
| Embedding router → reindex + query-engine | Phase 17 | Phase 17 | Connected |
| Embedding health → CLI command | Phase 17 | Phase 17 | Connected |
| Regeneration manager → MCP tools + serve.ts | Phase 18 | Phase 18/19 | Connected |
| Regeneration executor → serve.ts | Phase 18 | Phase 19 | Connected |
| startMcpHttpServer → serve.ts | Phase 19 | Phase 19 | Connected |
| originPolicy + bearerAuth → server.ts | Phase 20 | Phase 19 | Connected |
| verifyHttpSecurityPrerequisites → serve.ts | Phase 20 | Phase 19 | Connected |
| Config schema extensions → all consumers | Phase 17/19/20 | Multiple | Connected |

## E2E User Flows

| Flow | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Streaming QA | Start → progress → cancel/complete → resume | Complete |
| Local Embedding | Configure → health check → reindex → search | Complete |
| Remote Regeneration | Trigger via MCP → poll status → observe completion | Complete |
| HTTP Transport | Start HTTP serve → connect client → use tools | Complete |
| HTTP Security | Configure auth + origins → startup guard → middleware enforcement | Complete |

## Tech Debt Summary

### Phase 19: HTTP Transport Parity
- Missing VERIFICATION.md file (plans complete, integration verified by checker)

### Phases 16, 17, 18: Human Runtime Testing
- All code-level must-haves verified via static analysis
- Runtime delivery timing, real client interactions, and provider availability testing deferred
- 6 human verification items across 3 phases

### Total: 7 tech debt items across 4 phases
