### Findings Resolved During Audit

| #   | Finding                                                                    | Severity | Resolution                                               |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | AGENTS.md "No semicolons" contradicts `semi: true` in prettier.config.js   | Medium   | Fixed: changed to "Semicolons required" (commit 5a7874c) |
| 2   | development.md references `eslint.config.mjs` (actual: `eslint.config.js`) | Low      | Fixed: corrected filename (commit 5a7874c)               |

### Accepted Tech Debt

| #   | Item                                                           | Phase   | Severity | Rationale                                                                                        |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1   | `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md` superseded by root `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Ph1→Ph3 | Low      | Root file takes GitHub priority; `.github/` copy is unreachable but harmless                     |
| 2   | `format:check` not in CI                                       | Ph2     | Low      | Formatting enforced via pre-commit hook; contributors who skip hooks could land unformatted code |
| 3   | Publish job has no direct quality gate                         | Ph2     | Low      | Release PRs pass CI before merge; indirect enforcement is sufficient                             |
| 4   | Coverage thresholds (80%) not yet enforceable                  | Ph2     | Low      | Test coverage needs to reach threshold before enforcement is meaningful                          |

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow                                                        | Status   | Notes                                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| New contributor: README → clone → build → commit → PR → CI  | Complete | All steps verified; hooks fire correctly         |
| New issue: template chooser → YAML form → auto-label        | Complete | 3 templates + blank disabled                     |
| AI assistant: llms.txt → docs/ → AGENTS.md                  | Complete | 11 entries, all paths valid, ops rules accurate  |
| Release: conventional commit → release-please → npm publish | Complete | OIDC publish with provenance; PAT for CI trigger |

## Human Verification Required

10 items across 3 phases require manual testing (GitHub UI, external services, usability):

**Phase 1 (GitHub UI):**

1. Community Standards page shows green checkmarks
2. Issue template chooser works, blank issues disabled
3. PR template auto-populates
4. Sponsors button appears (requires enrollment)

**Phase 2 (External services):** 5. Codecov badge activates (needs CODECOV_TOKEN) 6. Scorecard badge activates (needs first workflow run) 7. Release-please → npm publish end-to-end (needs PAT + OIDC) 8. Coverage threshold enforcement at 80%

**Phase 3 (Usability):** 9. First-time contributor 15-minute test 10. User quickstart to first output
